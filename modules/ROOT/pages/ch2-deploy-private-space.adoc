You deploy apps to a private space using Runtime Manager.

. Click *Deploy application*.
. On the *Deploy Application* page:
.. Enter the <<app-name-reqs,name>> of the application.

*** To upload a Mule app JAR file from your system, select *Choose file > Upload file*.
*** To choose an example app from Anypoint Exchange:
.... Select *Choose file > Import file from Exchange*.
.... On the *Get from Exchange* page, enter `hello` in the *Search assets by name*:

[[configure-endpoint-path]]
== Configure Endpoints and Paths for the App

For more information, see xref:ch2-config-endpoints-paths.adoc[].

To configure endpoints for the app to enable access from the internet:

. Click the *Ingress* tab and specify the following options:
+
Public endpoint::
+
--
* *Domain*: Select the domain, such as `cloudhub.io`, for the app from the drop-down list.
+
[NOTE]
If you select `cloudhub.io` (the default domain), you can't select a subdomain or path.
+
The administrator configures the domains and certificates (TLS context) for the private space.
See xref:ps-config-domains.adoc[].
+
After you select the domain for a private space, you can view the corresponding TLS context by clicking *View TLS Context*:
+
<screenshot>
* *Subdomain*: If the domain you selected includes a wildcard, you can configure the subdomain.
+
include::partial$deployment.adoc[tag=subdomain-name-reqs]
+
Subdomains support <<placeholder-table,placeholders>>.
The default subdomain is `app-name`, which resolves to the name of the app that you specified in the *Application Name* field when you deploy the app.
* *Path*: specifies the URL path to the application endpoint.
+
include::partial$deployment.adoc[tag=path-name-reqs]
+
Paths support <<placeholder-table,placeholders>>.

* To add an endpoint, click *Add Endpoint* and specify options.
* To remove an endpoint, click the trash can icon (*Delete*) in the endpoint row.
* To copy an endpoint, click the copy icon (*Copy*) in the endpoint row.

Path Rewrite::
+
--
If the HTTP Listener in your app listens on a different path than the path defined in *Public Endpoints*:

. Enable the *Rewrite Request Paths* option.
. Enter the target path expected by your app.
+
Requests sent to your app use the path that you specify here.
. Click *Show Example* to see how the private space rewrites the path.
--
TLS Options::
* *Last-Mile Security*
+
--
Specifies that TLS termination and decryption for the forwarded HTTPS connections occurs in the application.

This option requires that the Mule application include an SSL certificate and also requires more CPU resources.
--
* *Forward SSL Session*
+
--
Enables SSL forwarding during a session.

SSL forwarding is mostly used with client authentication.
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-security/enable-client-authentication.html[Enable Client Authentication^] (Link out from Beta docs).
SSL forwarding forwards client certificate details in HTTP request headers so they are available to the application.
These fields can identify an authenticated client and allow an application to determine and use the identity.

The following headers are available:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
| Header Name | Value
| x-ssl-client-verify | SUCCESS/FAIL
| x-ssl-issuer | Client certificate issuer
| x-ssl-client-serial | Client certificate serial number
| x-ssl-client-dn | Contents of the client certificate DN field
| x-ssl-client-cert | Contents of the client certificate
|===

[[forward-logs]]
== Forward Logs to Other Services

If log forwarding is not configured for the private space, the options on the *Logs* tab are disabled.
See xref:ps-config-log-forwarding.adoc[].

Show logs in Anypoint Monitoring::
Forwards only application logs to Anypoint Monitoring and requires a Titanium subscription.

Forward logs to _service_::
Forwards application and load-balancer logs to the specified service:
+
** Azure
** Elasticsearch
** Graylog (GELF)
** Splunk
** CloudWatch

For information about viewing logs, see xref:ch2-view-logs.adoc[].
