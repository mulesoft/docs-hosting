= Configuring Endpoints and Paths for Apps Deployed to a Private Space

[IMPORTANT]
CloudHub 2.0 supports customizing public endpoints only for apps that are deployed to private spaces, not shared spaces.


A private space routes requests from clients to apps deployed to the private space.

When you deploy an app to a private space, both _public_ and _private endpoints_ are created, but you can modify only the public endpoint.
An _endpoint_ is the URL used to reach the app deployed to the private space,
for example `\https://my-app.example.com/`. Public endpoints enable clients outside of the network to reach the app. Private endpoints are accessible only within the private network, a VPN, or transit gateway (TGW). To ensure an app is accessible only within the network, you can remove public endpoints.

You can customize how requests from clients reach the app by configuring:

* Multiple custom public endpoints
+
The administrator specifies the domains that you can use for the public endpoints
by configuring the TLS context in the private space settings.
For information, see xref:ps-config-domains.adoc[].

* Different paths for the app and the public endpoint URL
+
The _path_ is the base path expected by the HTTP Listener in your app, for example `my-app.example.com/v1/api`.
+
For information, see xref:http-connector::http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP Listener Reference - Mule 4].

You can also remove the public endpoint to ensure clients outside of the private network cannot make requests to the app.


[[before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

The administrator must set up the TLS contexts for the private space before you can configure the endpoints and paths for the app.

For information, see xref:ps-config-domains.adoc[].


[[configure-multiple-endpoints]]
== Configure Multiple Public Endpoints

You can enable your app to be reached via multiple public endpoints, for example,
`my-app.example.com` and `my-old-app.oldname.com`.

[TIP]
To ensure that each endpoint name is unique, use the `app-name` placeholder in the subdomain,
or the path if the domain doesn't include a wildcard.

To configure multiple public endpoints:

. When deploying an app to a private space, click the *Ingress* tab.
+
See xref:ch2-deploy-private-space.adoc[].
+
If the app is already deployed:
+
--
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSettings]
. Click the *Ingress* tab.
--
. Configure the first endpoint:
.. Select the first domain from the *Domain* drop-down list, for example `&#x2a;.example.com`.
+
If the domain includes a wildcard, the *Subdomain* field becomes available.
.. Enter the subdomain, or enter the `my-app` placeholder in the *Subdomain* field to use the name of the app that you specified in the *Application Name* field as the subdomain.
+
For information, see <<placeholder-table,placeholders>>.
.. Enter the path where the HTTP Listener in the app is listening, for example `v1/api`.
. If you want to configure additional endpoints, click *Add Endpoint* and repeat steps 2.1 through 2.3.
. Depending on the deployment status, choose either:
** If you're ready to deploy the application, click *Deploy*.
** If this application is deployed, click *Apply Changes*.
. Verify that the app can be reached at each configured endpoint.

[[configure-different-paths]]
== Configure a Different Path for the App and the Public URL Endpoint

You can configure different paths for the app and the public URL endpoint.
For example, if the app is listening on `my-app.example.com/v1/api` and you
want the app to be reachable from the internet using `my-app.example.com/api`.


To configure different paths:

. xref:ch-deploy-private-space.adoc[Deploy the app to a private space].
. Click the *Ingress* tab.
. In the *Path* field, enter the path where you want the app to be reachable, for example, `/api`.
. In the *Path Rewrite* field, enter the base path expected by the HTTP Listener in your app, for example,  `/v1/api`.

. Click *Apply Changes* to create a new configuration for your application.
. Verify the path rewrite by clicking the public endpoint link and viewing the XML.
+
The API shows `/v1/api`, but URI is `/api`.

|HTTP Listener Path|Public Endpoint Path |Path Rewrite

[[remove-public-endpoint]]
== Remove a Public Endpoint

To remove a public endpoint:

//SELECT APP SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSettings]
. Click the *Ingress* tab.
. In the endpoint link row, click *X* (*Delete*).


[[view-private-endpoint]]
== View the Private Endpoint for an App

A private endpoint is accessible from inside the same private space or through
the VPN or transit gateway connection for the private space. You cannot make changes to the path or domain for a private endpoint.

To view or copy the URL for the private endpoint:

include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSettings]
. Click the *Ingress* tab.
. Hover over *private endpoint*.
