= Configuring Firewall Rules to Manage Traffic to a Private Space

By default, all traffic to your private space is blocked unless it is explicitly allowed in a firewall rule.

Creating a private space automatically creates these firewall rules:

* Two rules to allow inbound connections from any host:
** HTTPS: port 443
** HTTP: port 80

* Two rules to allow outbound connections from within your private space to any host:
** TCP: All ports
** HTTPS: 443
