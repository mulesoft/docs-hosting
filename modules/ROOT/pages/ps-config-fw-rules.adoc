= Configuring Firewall Rules to Manage Traffic to a Private Space

*This topic is updated to the Design Spec dated 09-Nov-21 and discussions*

*Last update* 08-Mar-22

By default, all traffic to your private space is blocked unless it is explicitly allowed in a firewall rule.

Creating a private space automatically creates these firewall rules:

* Two rules to allow inbound connections from any host:
** HTTP: port 80
** HTTPS: port 443

* Two rules to allow outbound connections from within your private space to any host:
** HTTP: All ports
** HTTPS: port 443
+
You can't delete this rule.

// Specify IP Addresses to Allow
