= Configure Firewall Rules to Manage Traffic to a Private Space
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

By default, all traffic to your private space is blocked unless it is explicitly allowed in a firewall rule.

Creating a private space automatically creates these firewall rules:

* Two rules to allow outbound connections from within your private space through ports 8091 and 8092.
* Two rules to allow inbound connections from any host through ports 8081 and 8082.

[NOTE]
You cannot configure firewall rules for ports below 1024.
