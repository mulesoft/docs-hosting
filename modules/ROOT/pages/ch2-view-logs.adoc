CloudHub 2.0 provides access to log data that includes deployment messages and events for each replica and Mule runtime engine logs.

For more advanced searching and log management, you can use Anypoint Monitoring (requires Titanium subscription).
See xref:monitoring::index.adoc[].

CloudHub 2.0 stores up to 200 MB of log data per config, or up to 30 days, whichever limit is reached first.
// Weâ€™re considering an additional limit for how many configs/deployments we keep track of.



[NOTE]
CloudHub 2.0 stores log data in Universal Time (UTC); however, the console displays the log using your computer's local time zone.

== View Logs

To view logs for applications deployed to a private space:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickLogs]
+
--
The logs page displays all logs for all replicas for the selected config,
with the latest messages at the bottom.
The config represents the deployment since the last update.

[NOTE]
When you update an application, a new configuration is created.
In this case, the logs page might be empty.

The page streams log messages as they occur, unless the last deployed section is closed.
Logs from before the last updated time appear in a drop-down containing previous deployments.

Each message includes the severity, time (relative and absolute), and replica name.

* To open the currently selected deployment in Anypoint Monitoring, click *View in Monitoring*.
* To view logs for a different config, click the *Config* drop-down list and select the config.

The config label indicates the relative time of deployment, such as 10 hours ago.

The results display includes the currently selected config, replica,
and log levels.

. Select filter options:
+
** Filter logs by config ID

Only the logs for the selected replica appear.
+
To clear the replica filter and display logs for all replicas, click the *X* button for the selected replica.

** *Filter logs by time date and time range*

** *Fatal*: Fatal messages for when an application fails
** *Error*: Error messages, such as when an exception occurs
** *Warn*: Warning messages
** *Info*: Informative messages
** *Debug*: Debugging messages
--

[NOTE]
Some log levels might not be available depending on the dynamic log level setting for the deployment.

The *Log Levels* button label changes to show the selected number of log levels.


== Download Logs

To download logs based on the current filters:

include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickLogs]
. Click the download (<icon>) button.
// +
// <screenshot>
// image::ch2-logs-download.png[Download log output]

CloudHub 2.0 downloads the log output, using the current filters, using a hexadecimal naming convention and the `log` format, for example: `c6c671_462ccf_2022-07-21T20-08-32X.log`. Use a text editor to view the log file.

== Download Mule Logs

Mule logs display the logs of the Mule runtime engine for CloudHub 2.0.
The Mule log contains information about app and lifecycle events.
For example, the log records an entry when a Mule service or app starts, deploys, stops, or undeploys.

 . In the *Deployments* section, select the date and worker for which you want to download Mule logs.
 . Click the download icon for the worker and select *Mule Logs*:

CloudHub downloads the Mule log output to a text file in the format `__appName__-instance-__instanceID__-__workerNumber__-mule_ee.log`.
Use a text editor to view the log file.

For more information about Mule logs, see xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc#runtime-log[Runtime Log^] (Link out from Beta docs).



=== Wildcard Searching

You can filter log data by entering search terms into the search box at the top of the log page that match results in the log message.

You can also search for an exact term in the log message with a few common quantifiers for wildcard searching:

* `?` matches zero or one of the preceding elements.
* `&#8727;` matches zero or more of the preceding elements.
