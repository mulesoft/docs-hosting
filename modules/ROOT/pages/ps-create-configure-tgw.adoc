= Creating Transit Gateway Attachments

// *This topic is updated to the TGW Design Specs dated 08-Nov-21*

*Last update* 09-Aug-22

Multiple private spaces can connect to an internal VPC.
You can reuse the transit gateway attachment by connecting another private space to it and accepting the attachment. 
You don't need to create the resource share again.

== Prerequisites

* Before creating a transit gateway attachment, xref:ps-create-configure.adoc#create-private-network[create the private network].
* Ensure the private space belongs to the same region in which you are creating the transit gateway attachment. Inter-region peering is not supported.
For example, you cannot attach transit gateway attachment from region A to a private space belonging to region B.

[[connect-tgw]]
== Connect to a Transit Gateway

// figure out how to share this entire bit with CH 1.0.

For information about limitations when attaching a VPC to a transit gateway, 
see 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[Transit gateway attachments to a VPC^] in the AWS documentation.

To connect to a transit gateway:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, *Create Connection*.
. On the *Create Connection* page, select *Transit Gateway*.
+
If CloudHub 2.0 finds any existing transit gateways in the organization,
you can select a transit gateway or click *Add a new transit gateway* and then enter the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#transit-gateway-name[name] in the *Connection Name* field.
+
Use the same name for your transit gateway in AWS.
You can change this name later.
+
// Shared Connection Name
include::partial$create-config.adoc[tag=connectionNameReqs]
. Click *Next*.

Depending on whether you selected an existing transit gateway or are 
adding a new one, the *Add Transit Gateway* page lists the steps to create a resource share in AWS:

. <<configure-tgw-routes,Configure routes>>.
. <<create-resource-share,Create a resource share>>. (new gateway only)
. <<verify-resource-share,Verify the resource share>>. (new gateway only)
. <<accept-tgw-attachment,Accept the attachment>>.

[[configure-tgw-routes]]
== Configure Routes

In *Static Routes*, enter the IP prefixes of the external networks to connect through the transit gateway, and then click *Next*.

The routes should match VPC CIDR range so traffic can flow between the private VPC in AWS and the private space in CloudHub 2.0. (???)

After you attach the transit gateway, the private space includes the routes you specify here.

To display the existing routes for the network, click *Show Existing Routes for this Network*.

You can add or remove routes later. 
For information, see 
xref:ps-manage.adoc#add-remove-routes[Add or Remove a Route from the Route Table].

[[create-resource-share]]
== Create a Resource Share

. In another browser window, sign in to your AWS corporate account.
. In Anypoint Platform, click the *Create Resource Share* link on the *Add Transit Gateway* page. 
+
The link opens the AWS RAM console to the page for creating a resource share in the region you specified for your private space.
. Take the following actions on the AWS *Create resource share* page:
+
--
.. Under *Description*, enter a descriptive name for the resource share in the *Name* field.
.. Under *Resources - _optional_*, select *Transit Gateways* from the *Select resource type* menu and select the transit gateway resource to share.
+
The transit gateway ID appears in the *Selected resources* field.
.. Under *Principals - _optional_*, ensure that *Allow external accounts* is selected, 
enter the MuleSoft AWS account ID that appears on the *Add Transit Gateway* page in Anypoint Platform, and click *Add*.
+
The AWS account number appears in the *Selected principals* field.
.. Under *Tags*, add a tag if you want.
.. Click *Create resource share*.
.. Copy the *ID* and *Owner* values for the resource share you just created. 
.. Click *Next*.
--

[[verify-resource-share]]
== Verify the Resource Share

. On the Anypoint Platform *Add Transit Gateway* page, paste the values you copied from AWS in the *ID* and *Owner* fields:
// +
// <screenshot>
+
--
*** The resource share *ID* field contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-).
*** The resource share *Owner* field contains only numbers.
--
. Click *Next*.


CloudHub 2.0 uses the resource share owner and ID you provide to attach
the associated transit gateway on AWS to the private space.

When the attachment succeeds, you see the `Attachment Created` message and 
you return to the *Add Transit Gateway* page.

If the resource share validation fails, see xref:ps-troubleshoot.adoc#troubleshoot-transit-gateway-attachments[Troubleshoot Transit Gateway Attachments].

[[accept-tgw-attachment]]
== Accept the Attachment 

. On the *Add Transit Gateway* page, click the *Transit Gateway Attachments* link. 
+
The link opens the AWS RAM console to the page for accepting the transit gateway attachments in the region you specified.
. On the *Transit Gateway Attachments* page, select the attachment that shows *pending acceptance* in the *State* column.
+
The attachment might take a few minutes to appear.
+
To verify that the attachment is correct, select the transit gateway attachment ID and, on the *Details* tab, ensure that the *Resource owner account ID* is the MuleSoft AWS account ID from the *Add Transit Gateway* page.
. From the *Actions* menu, select *Accept*.
. When the attachment state changes to *available*, return to the *Add Transit Gateway* page and click *Done*.
+
You return to the *Network* tab for the private space.
The *Connections* section shows the transit gateway ID and owner from AWS and indicates that the transit gateway state is *Available* and the attachment state is *Attached to Private Network*:
// +
// <screenshot>
// image::tgw-resource-share-available.png[Transit gateway attached]
+
If the VPC attachment state is *Not Attached to VPC*, the transit gateway is not attached.
Click *Accept the attachment* link and follow the steps again.
+
// If the VPC attachment state is `Rejected`, see xref:tgw-troubleshoot.adoc[].

[[configure-tgw-routing]]
== Configure Transit Gateway Routing

CloudHub 2.0 supports static routing for transit gateways.

Configure the network routes (subnets) that you want to be accessible through the transit gateway:

* On Anypoint Platform, <<enable-outbound-traffic-from-ps,configure routes for outbound traffic from the private space>> to an external destination.
* On AWS, <<enable-inbound-traffic-on-aws,enable inbound traffic>> through your transit gateway. 

[[enable-outbound-traffic-from-ps]]
=== Configure Routes for Outbound Traffic from the Private Space

After the *Attached to Private Network* message appears, the private spaces adds the routes that you 
<<connect-tgw,specified>>
so that apps deployed to the private space can access the transit gateway.

To add routes to the transit gateway route table, see
xref:ps-manage.adoc#add-remove-routes[Add or Remove a Route from the Route Table].

[[enable-inbound-traffic-on-aws]]
=== Enable Inbound Traffic Through the Transit Gateway

After successfully adding routes to the transit gateway route table in Anypoint Platform, enable inbound traffic through your transit gateway on AWS. 

You might need to coordinate with your network administrator to enable inbound traffic.


[[test-connection]]
== Test the Connection to Your Private Space

After you connect to a transit gateway,
test the connectivity from CloudHub 2.0 to your networks.
To test the connection, use the Network Tools application.

For download and usage information about the Network Tools application, see https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-To-Use-Network-Tools-Application[How To Use Network Tools Application^] (KB article).
