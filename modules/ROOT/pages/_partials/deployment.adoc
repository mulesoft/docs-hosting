= Change App Behavior with Properties

You can configure property values, such as specifying the environment or setting passwords and usernames, during app deployment.

For information about configuring app properties, see:

= Download a Test App from Exchange

If you don't have a Mule app to test with, you can download an example app from Anypoint Exchange.

[NOTE]
You must be logged into your Anypoint Platform account to see the example assets on Exchange. 

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Exchange*.
. From the *All assets* list, select *Provided by MuleSoft*.
. From the *All types* menu, select *Examples*.

[[app-name-reqs]]
= Application Names

*FROM CLOUDHUB 1.0*

The application name can contain between 3 and 42 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and dashes (-).
They cannot contain spaces or other characters.

// NO RENAME SHARED
[IMPORTANT]
include::partial$caveats.adoc[tag=noRenameApp]

The application name identifies your application not only in Runtime Manager but also in the public `cloudhub.io` domain.
For example, an application named `myapplication` is accessible at `+http://myapplication.cloudhub.io+`.


To avoid domain conflicts, the application name must be globally unique across CloudHub 2.0.
For this reason, create a naming convention to ensure unique application names.
For example, you could prepend your company name and department to all application names,
such as `mycompany-mydept-myapplication`.
You can then add DNS records to hide the complex application name.
For example, you might route requests to `myapplication.mycompany.com` to `mycompany-mydept-myapplication.cloudhub.io`.

= Enable TLS v1 and TLS v1.1

*REMOVE THIS CONTENT FOR GA?*

Starting with the https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/cloudhub/cloudhub-runtimes-release-notes#august-3-2021[August 3, 2021 patch releases^], Mule runtime engine disables TLS v1 and TLS v1.1 by default for all runtime versions.

If your app requires TLS v1 or TLS v1.1, you can enable them using JVM (Java Virtual Machine) arguments when you deploy to CloudHub 2.0:

. Click the *JVM* tab. 
. In the *Java Virtual Machine arguments* field, add one of the following arguments:
* Enable TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1:
+
`-Drtf.allow.TLSv1.0+`
* Enable TLSv1.1:
+
`-Drtf.allow.TLSv1.1`
// end::enableTLSv1[]
