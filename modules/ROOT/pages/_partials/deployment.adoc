[[app-properties]]
= Change App Behavior with Properties

You can configure property values, such as specifying the environment or setting passwords and usernames, during app deployment.

For information about configuring app properties, see:

* xref:ch2-manage-props.adoc[] 
* xref:ch2-protect-app-props.adoc[]

// tag::placeholders[]
[[placeholder-table]]
= Placeholders

The subdomain and path support the following optional lowercase placeholders:

[%header,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Placeholder | Resolves to
| `app-name` | Name of the app that you specified in the *Application Name* field when you deploy the app
| `business-group-id` | Business group ID associated with the app
| `environment-id` | Environment that you deploy the app to
|===
// end::placeholders[]

// tag::path-name-reqs[]
Paths must start and end with an alphanumeric character and can contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
// end::path-name-reqs[]

// tag::subdomain-name-reqs[]
Subdomains must start and end with an alphanumeric character and can contain only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (-), and periods (.).
// end::subdomain-name-reqs[]

// tag::appNameReqs[]
[[app-name-reqs]]
= Application Names

The application name you specify can contain between three and 59 alphanumeric characters
(a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and dashes (-).
They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
The application name must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z). It cannot start with a number or dash.

To ensure that names are unique and avoid domain conflicts, CloudHub 2.0 adds
a six-character `_uniq-id_` to the application name that you specify in the public endpoint URL.

The application name identifies your application not only in Runtime Manager but also in the public `cloudhub.io` domain.
For example, an application named `myapp` is accessible at `\http://myapp-_uniq-id_._shard_.usa-w2.cloudhub.io`.

To further customize your app names, you can create a naming convention.
For example, you could prepend your company name and department to all application names,
such as `mycompany-mydept-myapp`.
You can then add DNS records to hide the complex application name.
For example, you might route requests to `myapp.mycompany.com` to `mycompany-mydept-myapp-_uniq-id_._shard_._region_.cloudhub.io`.

// tag::configureLogging[]
[[configure-logging]]
= Configure Logging for the App

Logging is enabled by default for apps deployed to CloudHub 2.0.

To disable logging and metrics for the app or configure additional log levels and categories to include in logs:

. Click the *Logging* tab.
. Deselect the logging option:
+
** Titanium subscribers: *Enable application logs and metrics*
** Non-Titanium subscribers: *Enable application logs*
. Select the log level:
+
** *Fatal*: Fatal messages for when an application fails
** *Error*: Error messages, such as when an exception occurs
** *Warn*: Warning messages
** *Info*: Informative messages
** *Debug*: Debugging messages

. Optionally, set the log level for specific a Java package class by
clicking *Add Class*, entering the class name, and selecting the log level.

// tag::specifyRuntimeOpts[]
[[specify-runtime-options]]
== Specify Runtime Options 

Click the *Runtime* tab and specify the following options:

Runtime version::
Specifies the Mule runtime engine version.
Replica size::
Specifies the number of vCores in the replica to run your application.
+
For information on replica sizes, memory, and storage, see
xref:ch2-architecture.adoc#cloudhub-2-replicas[CloudHub 2.0 Replicas].
CloudHub 2.0 limits the replica size per deployment to four vCores.
Replicas::
Specifies the number of replicas, or instances, of the application to deploy.
+
A minimum of two replicas is required for high availability.
Run in Runtime Cluster Mode::
Enables xref:docs-rft-cloud::ch2-clustering.adoc[Mule clustering] across each replica of the application.
Enforce deploying replicas across nodes::
Selecting this option might cause some replicas in the deployment to remain in Pending status if there are unsufficient worker nodes or resources available on the worker nodes needed to deploy each replica.
The deployment status transitions to Running after all replicas are deployed on different worker nodes.

Deployment model::
+
--
* *Rolling update*:
** Maintains availability by incrementally updating replicas.
** Requires one additional replica's worth of resources to succeed.

* *Recreate*:
** Terminates replicas before redeployment.
** Redeployment is faster and doesn't require additional resources.
