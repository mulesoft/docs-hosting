= Upgrading CloudHub 1.0 to CloudHub 2.0

CloudHub 2.0 provides the ability to upgrade your existing VPCs in CloudHub 1.0 to private spaces.

When you upgrade a VPC to a private space, CloudHub 2.0 creates the new private space using all the settings from the VPC except the TLS contexts.

You can create one private space per VPC.


== Upgrade a VPC to a Private Space

To upgrade a CloudHub 1.0 VPC to a private space:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager* > *VPCs*.
. Click in the *Region* column for the VPC to upgrade.
. In the details pane, click *Upgrade to Private Space*.
. Enter the name for the private space and click *Upgrade Now*.
+
CloudHub 2.0 creates the new private space and adds it to the *Private Spaces* page.
The networking configuration can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
+
After the private space is created, you can continue to manage the VPC that you upgraded. 
However, the *Delete VPC* option is no longer available for the VPC.
. After the private space is created, create the TLS context.
+
