*THIS IS CH 1.0 PLACEHOLDER CONTENT UNTIL THE UI IS AVAILABLE* 

You can change the behavior of the app while it's running using _properties_.

Application properties are variables that act as placeholders in your Mule application and are set at runtime.
When you deploy an application or update an existing application in Runtime Manager, Mule runtime engine supplies the values for the property variables using the information you configure in the *Properties* tab.

For example, you can configure a JDBC connector in which the username is set to `${dbUsername}` and the password is set to `${dbPassword}`.
In Runtime Manager, you can set these two properties as application properties.

For sensitive information, you can protect the property values so that,
after you save them in Runtime Manager, their values aren't visible in the console
or passed between the console and CloudHub 2.0.
For information, see xref:ps-protect-app-props.adoc[Protect App Property Values].

You can properties in either Anypoint Runtime Manager or a properties file.
If you set properties both in the properties file in your application and in Runtime Manager, the values set in Runtime Manager always override the values in the properties file when your application deploys.

== Add Application Properties in Runtime Manager 

The easiest way to load properties to applications deployed to a private space is to define them
in the *Properties* tab for the application.


To add properties: 

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
. Click the app name.
. In the navigation menu, click *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:
+
<replace screenshot>
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Properties* tab, (*2*) the *List* button, (*3*) the key and value fields, and (*4*) the *X* icon on the application *Settings* page.
image::ch2-app-props.png[*Properties* tab, key and value fields, and *X* icon on the application *Settings* page]
. Click *Table view*.
+
Alternatively, you can click *Text view* and enter the key-value pair in the text field in this format: `key=value`.
. Enter the property name in the key field.
. Enter the property value in the value field.
+
[NOTE]
If the save password feature of Chrome is enabled and includes a username for `anypoint.mulesoft.com` that matches the contents of the key field, Chrome overwrites the value field with the stored password associated with that username. 
To work around this limitation, use Chrome in incognito mode or use another browser.

** If you want to hide the value in Runtime Manager, click *Protect* and then click *Protect value* to confirm.
+
See xref:ps-protect-app-props.adoc[Protect App Property Values].
** If you want to change a key or value, edit the text in the field.
** If you want to delete a property, click *X*.
** Click *Apply Changes*.
--
. Select *Restart* from the menu in the top right to restart the application.


=== Example: Using Properties to Set Environment Variables 

You can specify Java system environment variables, which function the same as adding environment variables when you deploy to an on-premises server.

You can also configure environment variables for your application.
Properties enable you to externalize settings that change depending on the environment you're deploying to.
For example, if you use a Mule application locally, you might configure your database host to be `0.0.0.0`.
If you deploy the same app to CloudHub 2.0, you might configure the database host to be an Amazon RDS server.

To create set an environment variable using an application property:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
. Click the app name.
. In the navigation menu, click *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab. 
. Define the variable by entering it in the *Text view*, in `key=value` format:
+
<replace screenshot>
+
.The arrow shows the variable on the *Properties* tab of the application *Settings* page.
image::rtm-env-variables.png[*Properties* tab on the *Settings* page]
+
[NOTE]
In the *Text* view, use the backslash character (`\`) as an escape character.
For example, to use `:` in a key or value, use `\:` in the syntax.
To use `\` in a key or value, use `\\` in the syntax.
*List* view syntax requires no escape character.

. Use the environment variable in your Mule app configuration.

== Add Application Properties Using a Properties File

You can add properties to an app by including a file in the deployable application archive file:

* Property placeholder YAML file (Mule 4)
+
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/configuring-properties[Configuring Properties^] (Mule 4) (Link out from Beta docs).
* `mule-app.properties` (Mule 3)
+
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/3.9/configuring-properties[Configuring Properties^] (Mule 3) (Link out from Beta docs).

CloudHub 2.0 then loads these properties into the application when the application starts. 

Although this method is not the best practice on CloudHub 2.0 (because the *Properties* tab values override any with the same name in the file), you can work around this by changing options in the Mule app.

To prevent CloudHub 2.0 properties from overriding properties bundled with the deployable archive, change options in the `property-placeholder` element in the Mule application.
For more information about nondefault property placeholder options, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.html[Spring documentation on Property Placeholder options^].

== Reserved Properties 

*These values are for CH 1.0 - still applicable? I guess remove worker-specific props?*

CloudHub 2.0 reserves a set of properties and prevents apps from overwriting the values of those properties.
If an application attempts to assign a value to a reserved property, CloudHub 2.0 doesn't use the assigned value.
Instead, it returns the value as set internally, without throwing an error or exception, and adds a warning message to the log.

Applications can reference reserved properties, for example, to retrieve the application name or deployment region.
Use the `${csorganization.id}` and `${environment.id}` properties to retrieve those values if your app makes Anypoint Platform API calls.
Use `${worker.id}` to identify each worker in a multiworker application.

[IMPORTANT]
Do not use the `${spring.profiles.active}` and `${logging.*}` properties.
