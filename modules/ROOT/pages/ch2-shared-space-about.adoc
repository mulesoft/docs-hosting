= Shared Spaces

*Last update* 16-Mar-22

A _shared space_ is an elastic cloud of resources that includes Mule instances running in
a multi-tenant environment. 
CloudHub 2.0 provides one shared space in each supported xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#private-network-region[region], to which you deploy your integration applications.

Deploying to a shared space requires no setup or maintenance of the underlying infrastructure.

You can deploy apps to the shared space in a region if:

* You don't require isolation from the public cloud.
* Your apps don't need to connect to an on-premises data center.
* Your apps can use the `cloudhub.io` domain name (rather than a vanity domain name).
* You don't need to configure custom certificates.
// * You don't need to forward logs to an external services.

Any of the following features and functionality requires a private space: 

* Single-tenancy for your apps
* Network connection (VPN or transit gateway attachment) to a data center
* Vanity domain names
* Custom certificates
// * Log forwarding
