== Load Balancer Log Levels 

CloudHub 2.0 enables you to specify the severity level of messages that are written to the log file.

[%header,cols="2*a"]
.CloudHub 2.0 Log Levels
|===
| Level 
| Description

| All Priorities
| All messages

| ERROR
| Only error messages, such when an exception occurs

| FATAL
| Only fatal messages when an application fails

| INFO
| Informative messages

| SYSTEM

You can specify log levels for a Mule application or API proxy during deployment.

////
You can use Anypoint Runtime Manager to change the application log level by configuring the following property:
```
logging.level.<PACKAGE>=LEVEL
``` 
For example, if you use Runtime Manager to add the 
`logging.level.org.mule.service.http.impl.service.HttpMessageLogger=DEBUG` property, `DEBUG` level log information is emitted from `HttpMessageLogger`.
