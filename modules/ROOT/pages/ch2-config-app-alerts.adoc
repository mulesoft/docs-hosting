= Configuring Application Alerts

*Last update* 11-Mar-22

_Alerts_ indicate whether an app is behaving as expected. You can create alerts in Runtime Manager for applications deployed to CloudHub 2.0.
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts^] (Link out from Beta docs).

== Rate Limits on Alerts

Anypoint Platform enforces rate limits that determine how often an alert is triggered and prevent excessive emails from being sent. The rate limit is one alert notification email sent every 2.5 seconds per organization.

This limit is enforced by a combination of organization, environment, alert (name or ID), and application.

== Before You Begin

* Ensure that your default environment (defined in your profile) has Read Application permissions.

== Create a Custom Alert

Use Runtime Manager to set up an alert related to successful app deployment:

// SELECT APPS SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
. In the navigation menu, click *Alerts*.
. On the *Alerts* page, click the blue plus icon (*+*).

+
Name::
Enter a meaningful name for the custom alert.
Severity level::
Select the severity level to apply to the alert:
* *Critical*
* *Warning*
* *Info*
Source::
Select *Applications* for the alert source.
Application type::
Select *CloudHub Applications*.
Applications::
Select the application that contains the flow that you configured to trigger a custom notification.
Condition::
Select one of the following:
** Deployment success: An app deploys and runs
** Deployment failure: An app cannot deploy. Note that this condition is triggered only for failures and not when the app is stuck in a deployment loop.
Subject::
Enter the subject line to include in the notification email.
Message::
Enter the custom message to include in the notification.
Recipients::
Enter the email addresses for notification recipients.

+
You can use variables in the alert *Subject* and *Message* fields.
