Use the following sections to gather the information you'll need to set up your private space.
For information about private spaces, see xref:index.adoc#what-is-a-private-space[What is a Private Space?].

You might need to collaborate with your network administrator if you don't have access to this information.
In this case, share this setup checklist with them and provide an estimate of the number of apps you expect to deploy
to the private space for <<CIDR Block,CIDR block>> configuration.

== Private Network Requirements 

* <<Name>>
* <<Region>>
* <<CIDR Block>>
* <<Connection Type>>
* <<Internal DNS Server (Optional)>>

=== Name

Private space names can contain up to 60 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), spaces, and hyphens (-).
Runtime Manager supports Unicode characters in private space names.

The private space name appears in the list when you select a deployment target for your apps.

You can rename a private space, if necessary.


=== Region

The _region_ is the Amazon region to deploy your apps to, such as `us-east-1`.

The complete list of supported regions is:

----
US East (Northern Virginia)
US East (Ohio)
US West (Northern California)
US West (Oregon)
Canada (Central)
South America (Sao Paulo)
Europe (Ireland)
Europe (Frankfurt)
Europe (London)
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Sydney)
Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
----


////

The region to which you deploy your application determines the DNS record for your integration.
For example, if you deploy an application named `myapp` to Canada (Central),
the domain used to access the application is `myapp.ca-c1.cloudhub.io`. 

The complete list of supported regions is:

[%header]
.Supported Regions 
|===
|Region|DNS Record
|US East (Northern Virginia)| `us-e1.cloudhub.io`
|US East (Ohio)| `us-e2.cloudhub.io`
|US West (Northern California)| `us-w1.cloudhub.io`
|US West (Oregon)| `us-w2.cloudhub.io`
|Canada (Central)| `ca-c1.cloudhub.io`
|South America (Sao Paulo)| `br-s1.cloudhub.io`
|Europe (Ireland)| `ir-e1.cloudhub.io`
|Europe (Frankfurt)| `de-c1.cloudhub.io`
|Europe (London)| `uk-e1.cloudhub.io`
|Asia Pacific (Singapore)| `sg-s1.cloudhub.io`
|Asia Pacific (Sydney)| `au-s1.cloudhub.io`
|Asia Pacific (Tokyo)| `jp-e1.cloudhub.io`
|===
////

=== CIDR Block 

The _CIDR block_ is the range of IPv4 addresses, in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation
that the apps deployed in your private space use.
The CIDR block defines the size of the private space.
For example, to grant your private network 256 IP addresses between `10.111.0.0` and `10.111.0.255`, 
set the CIDR block to `10.111.0.0/24`.

When you create a private space, you must specify the CIDR block.
You can't resize or change the CIDR block after you create the private space.
For this reason, ensure that you correctly anticipate your requirements before configuring this parameter.

Because some addresses are reserved for fault tolerance, infrastructure, and zero-downtime,
the allowed block size that you can assign for your Anypoint VPC is between `/16` and `/28`.

[%header]
.CIDR Block Sizing 
|===
| Netmask | Number of IP Addresses
| `/16`| 65,536
| `/28`| 16
|===

To estimate the size required for the CIDR block, multiply by 10 the number apps expected to deploy
in the private space.
For more specific estimations, use an internet tool for calculating CIDR ranges.

When specifying CIDR blocks, ensure that the CIDR blocks:

* Are from a private IP space
* Don't overlap with any other CIDR blocks assigned to your other private spaces
* Don't overlap with any CIDR blocks in use in your corporate network



=== Internal DNS Server (Optional)

To enable apps deployed to a private space to access
internal resources that are not reachable from the public internet, 
configure domain resolution for your internal networks.

To configure the internal DNS server, specify the IP address for your internal 
domain server and the internal domains that you want to access from the private space.
The private space resolves the domains using the specified DNS server, 
enabling you to use internal host names in your private network
as long as your applications use the FQDN to request back-end resources. 

==== Server IP Addresses

The _Server IP addresses_ identify the internal name servers that respond to DNS queries for the specified internal domains.

To provide redundancy, you can configure multiple internal DNS servers.

When configuring the IP addresses for the DNS servers, keep the following in mind:

* You configure DNS servers within a private space, so the server IP addresses you configure must be reachable from the private space.
+
If the server isn't reachable, DNS resolution fails.
* If you configure multiple servers, the private space queries any DNS server in the list for the specified domains at any time, in any order.
* All name servers must present the same DNS record.
* After the private space receives a valid response from any configured name server, it doesn't retry the request.
+
If one of the name servers doesn't have a record for the domain,
it returns the response `NXDOMAIN` (non-existent domain).
Because this response is valid, the private space doesn't send the query
to the other servers. 


==== Domains

_Domains_ identify the internal domains that must be accessible from the private space.
The configured internal DNS servers resolve the specified domaina, and the 
external DNS server resolves all other domains.

To specify an internal domain, use the second-level domain name, such as `mulesoft.com`.

[NOTE]
The total number of characters for all configured domains is 229.


=== Connection Type

* <<VPN Requirements,Virtual Private Network (VPN)>>
* <<Transit Gateway Attachment Requirements,Transit Gateway Attachment>>

== VPN Requirements 

* <<Remote IP Address>>
* <<Dynamic VPN Connection Requirements>>
* <<Static VPN Connection Requirements>>
* <<Local ASN>>
* <<Remote ASN>> (dynamic routing only)
* <<Static IP Prefixes>> (static routing only)
* <<Inside IP CIDRs>> (custom tunnel configuration only)
* <<Pre-shared Keys>> (custom tunnel configuration only)
* <<Supported Gateway Devices>>

=== Remote IP Address 

The _remote IP address_ is the public (single, static) IP address of your VPN endpoint.

=== Dynamic VPN Routing (BGP)

For dynamic routing, your device uses Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to advertise routes to Anypoint VPN.
If your device supports BGP, select dynamic routing. 

To create a dynamic VPN connection, in addition to the static VPN connection requirements, 
your VPN device must be able to:

* Establish BGP peering
* Support route-based VPNs (bind tunnels to logical interfaces)

////
Dynamic (BGP) Routing Type option should link to an explanation of the difference between routing types, especially related to how they handle failover when a redundant VPN exists.
////

=== Static VPN Routing

Static routing requires you to specify the routes (subnets) in your network that are accessible through Anypoint VPN.

To create a static VPN connection, your VPN endpoint must be able to:

* Establish IKE Security Associations using a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) 
* Establish IPsec Security Associations in Tunnel mode
* Use any combination of IPsec settings that Anypoint Platform supports
* Fragment IP packets before encryption 
+
You must fragment packets that are too large to transmit.
+
Your gateway device must be able to fragment packets before encapsulation.
* Use one Security Association (SA) pair per tunnel 
+
Anypoint VPN supports one unique SA pair (one inbound and one outbound connection) per tunnel.
Some policy-based devices create an SA for each ACL (access-control list) entry.
In this situation, you must consolidate your rules and then filter unwanted traffic.
* Use IPsec Dead Peer Detection (DPD)
+
DPD allows devices to rapidly identify when network conditions change.
You can enable DPD on the Anypoint Platform endpoint using `DPD Interval: 10` and `DPD Retries: 3`.
* Allow asymmetric routing 
+
Asymmetric routing occurs when routing policies send traffic from your network to the VPC through one tunnel and traffic returns from the VPC through the other tunnel.
The Anypoint Platform VPN endpoint selects the tunnel using an internal algorithm, making the return path dynamic.
If your device uses an active/active tunnel configuration, you must allow asymmetric routing for each Anypoint VPN connection.



=== Local ASN 

The _local ASN_ (Autonomous System Number) specifies a private ASN (`64512–65534`) to assign to the Anypoint Platform side of the VPN.

Use a private ASN that is not already assigned to your network.
The default value is `64512`.

[NOTE]
You configure the local ASN for both static and dynamic routing.

include::partial$caveats.adoc[tag=localAsnNote]
For subsequent VPNs that you create in the private space,
the *Local ASN* option is not available for static routing.

To change the local ASN after creating the VPN,
you must delete all existing connections first.

////
Local ASN is a property of the VPN gateway, which is used for all VPNs in a private space and must be created with its first VPN. The only opportunity to set the Local ASN is when the VPN gateway is created.

However, to answer your second question, Michelle said that users can set a different Local ASN when creating a VPN if they delete all existing connections first, presumably because we'll create a new VPN gateway at that point.
////


=== Remote ASN

The _remote ASN_ specifies a private ASN that corresponds to your backend.

[NOTE]
You configure the remote ASN only for dynamic routing. 

Use either an existing ASN assigned to your network or a private ASN (`64512–65534`) that is not 
already assigned to your network.
The default value is `65001`.


=== Static IP Prefixes

The _static IP prefixes_ are IP prefixes to advertise to your private network in Anypoint Platform,
in CIDR notation.

[NOTE]
You configure the static IP prefixes only for static routing.

A maximum of 95 route table entries is allowed per private network,
regardless of the number of VPN connections.
To avoid exceeding the limit, consolidate networks to the fewest number possible.


=== Custom Tunnel Configuration (Optional)

Select custom tunnel configuration if you want to specify custom values for
inside IP CIDRs and pre-shared keys.

Any values that you don't specify are autogenerated.

If you select automatic tunnel configuration, all values are auto-generated.

==== Inside IP CIDRs

The _inside IP CIDRs_ is the IP address range for the internal address of the VPN tunnel.

[NOTE]
You specify the inside IP CIDRs only for custom tunnel configuration. 
For automatic tunnel configuration, these values are auto-generated.

For each tunnel, enter the IP address range for the internal address of the VPN tunnel.

You can specify a size /30 CIDR block from the `169.254.0.0/16` range.
The CIDR block must be unique across all private network connections.

You cannot use the following reserved CIDR blocks:

----
169.254.0.0/30
169.254.1.0/30
169.254.2.0/30
169.254.3.0/30
169.254.4.0/30
169.254.5.0/30
169.254.169.252/30
----

==== Pre-shared Keys

A _pre-shared key_ (PSK) is a shared secret which was previously shared between 
two ends of a connection for the VPN tunnels.

[NOTE]
You specify the PSK only for custom tunnel configuration. 
For automatic tunnel configuration, these values are auto-generated.

For static connections, your VPN endpoint uses pre-shared keys (PSKs) to establish IKE Security Associations.

For each tunnel, enter a value of between 8-64 characters that does not begin with zero (0).
Use only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), and underscores (&#95;). 




=== Supported Gateway Devices

A _gateway device_ is a physical or software appliance on your organization's side of the VPN connection.

Your network administrator must configure the device to work with the Anypoint VPN connection.

The following gateway network devices are known to work with Anypoint VPN.
If your device does not appear in the list of tested devices,
check the requirements to verify that your device is suitable for use with Anypoint VPN.

== Redundant VPN

The default value for *Remote ASN* is inherited from the first VPN.
You can change this value.

////

Explanation of the difference between routing types, especially related to how they handle failover when a redundant VPN exists.


Create a redundant VPN connection to the same external network to reduce downtime if another VPN or gateway fails. Because this connection uses dynamic routing, failover will be automatic.

== Transit Gateway Attachment Requirements


* <<transit-gateway-name>>
* <<transit-gateway-region>>
* <<transit-gateway-routing>>

=== Prerequisites

Before you can add a transit gateway to CloudHub:

* Create a transit gateway on your corporate AWS account.
+
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-getting-started.html[Getting started with transit gateways^] in the AWS documentation for information about creating a transit gateway on AWS.
+
One transit gateway can support up to 10 VPC attachments.
* Purchase a Private Space offering with AWS Transit Gateway entitlements.
+
The *Transit Gateways* page is visible in Runtime Manager to Anypoint organizations that have an Anypoint VPC and VPN license.
+
Attaching one Anypoint VPC to an AWS Transit Gateway uses one Anypoint VPN license.
* Sign in to an Anypoint Platform account with either the CloudHub 2.0 Network Administrator or the CloudHub 2.0 Network Viewer user permission.
+
See xref:access-management::users.adoc#grant-permissions-and-roles-to-users[Grant Permissions and Roles to Users].

* Identify the subnets in your network (in CIDR notation) that you want to make accessible through the transit gateway.

[[transit-gateway-name]]
=== Name

Transit gateway attachment names can contain up to 255 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-).
Runtime Manager supports Unicode characters in private space names.

Use the same name for your transit gateway in AWS. 
You can change this name later. 

[[transit-gateway-region]]
=== Region

The region corresponds to the location your AWS Transit Gateway.

Your private space and AWS Transit Gateway must be in the same region.

[[transit-gateway-routing]]
=== Routing

A maximum of 95 route table entries is permitted per VPC, regardless of the number of transit gateway attachments.
Consolidate networks to the fewest number possible to avoid exceeding the limit.
