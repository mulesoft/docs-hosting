= Creating and Configuring Private Spaces

*This topic is updated to the TGW and VPN Design Specs dated 08-Nov-21*

*Last update* 10-Feb-22

To extend your network to Anypoint Platform, create a _private space_, 
a virtual, private, and isolated network hosted in CloudHub 2.0,
to deploy your apps to.

[[create-private-space]]
== Create a Private Space 

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
. Click *Create private space*.
. Enter a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#name[name] for your private space and click *Create*.

[[create-private-network]]
== Create a Private Network

[IMPORTANT]
You can't change the private network configuration after it's created.
To change the configuration, delete the private space and create it again.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. In the *Network* tab, click *Create Private Network*. 
. In the *Create Private Network* page:
.. Select the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#region[region] where you want your apps to run.
.. Enter the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#cidr-block[CIDR block], which is the range of IP addresses that your apps can use.
.. Click *Create*.
+
The private network can take up to 30 minutes to create.
+
While the network is created, you can 
<<create-connection-to-external-network,create a connection to an external network>>.
. After the network creation succeeds, xref:ch2-deploy.adoc[deploy an application] to test the private network.

If the private network creation fails, delete it and click *Create Private Network* to try again.

[[resolve-private-domains]]
=== Resolve Private Domains in Your Internal Network

If your corporate network uses internal DNS servers to resolve requests to custom domains, configure the private space with these IP addresses and domain names.
The private space uses your internal DNS to resolve internal host names of your private network (make sure your applications call the backend resources by FQDN).

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. In the *Network* tab, click the *Configure* link for *Internal DNS servers*.
. Enter the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#server-ip-addresses[server IP addresses] for your internal DNS servers.
. Enter the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#domains[domain addresses] to be resolved by internal DNS.
. Click *Save*.

After you configure internal DNS, the *Network* tab indicates the number of server IP addresses and domains:

[[create-connection-to-external-network]]
== Create a Connection to an External Network

After you create your private network, connect it to an external network using a 
VPN or transit gateway attachment.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
. In the *Network* tab, click *Create Connection*. 
. In the *Create Connection* page:

except the static IP prefixes for static routing.

. On the *Create Connection* page, enter a name for your connection, and then click *Next*.
+
// Shared Connection Name
include::partial$create-config.adoc[tag=connectionNameReqs]
. On the *Create VPN* page, enter the 
xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#remote-ip-address[remote IP address] (a single, static IP address) for your VPN endpoint.
. Select the routing type:
+
xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#dynamic-vpn-routing-bgp[Dynamic (BGP)]::
Select this option if your device supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
BGP supports automatic failover for redundant connections.
+
.. In the *Local ASN* field, enter a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#local-asn[local private ASN] that isn't already assigned to your network.

.. In the *Remote ASN* field, enter a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#remote-asn[private ASN].
+
Click *Show Existing Routes for this Network* to view the existing routes for the private network.

xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#static-vpn-routing[Static]::

+
include::partial$caveats.adoc[tag=localAsnNote]
+
If you have already created a VPN in this private space, the *Create VPN* page doesn't display the *Local ASN* field.
+
.. In the *Static Routes* field, specify the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#static-ip-prefixes[static IP prefixes] in CIDR notation.
+
Click *Show Existing Routes for this Network* to view the existing routes for the private network.

. Select the tunnel configuration:
+

This option requires no further configuration.
All values are auto-generated.
xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#custom-tunnel-configuration-optional[Custom]::
Any values that you don't specify are autogenerated.
+
.. Specify the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#inside-ip-cidrs[IP ranges] (in CIDR format) for the internal address of each VPN tunnel.
.. Specify the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#pre-shared-keys[pre-shared keys] (PSKs) for each VPN tunnel.

. Click *Create VPN*. 
+
The VPN can take up to 15 minutes to create.
+
While the VPN is created, you can <<create-redundant-vpn,create a redundant VPN>>.

. <<test-connection,Test the connection>> from your private space to the VPN.

[[create-redundant-vpn]]
=== Create a Redundant VPN

Redundant VPNs inherit some settings from the intial VPN configuration automatically.

[NOTE]
After you create a redundant VPN, you can't change any of the settings.

. In the *Network* tab, click *Create Redundant VPN*.
. In the *Create Redundant VPN* page, complete the fields, based on the routing type of the initial VPN:
+
Dynamic (BGP)::
+
.. In the *Remote IP* field, Enter the public IP address 
(a single, static IP address that isn't used by other VPNs) of your VPN endpoint.
.. In the *Remote ASN* field, enter a private ASN.
+
By default, *Remote ASN* contains the value from the first VPN, but you can change this value.
Static::
+
In the *Remote IP* field, enter the public IP address 
(a single, static IP address that isn't used by other VPNs) of your VPN endpoint.
+
Because you have already created a VPN in this private space, the *Create VPN* page doesn't display the *Local ASN* field.
. Select the tunnel configuration:
+
Automatic::
This option requires no further configuration.
All values are auto-generated.
Custom::
+
.. Specify the IP ranges (in CIDR format) for the internal address of each VPN tunnel.
.. Specify the PSKs for each VPN tunnel.
. Click *Create Redundant VPN*. 

The redundant VPN can take up to 15 minutes to create.

If the redundant VPN creation fails, click *Create Redundant VPN* to try again.

[[connect-vpn]]
=== Connect a VPN to Your Corporate Network 

To connect the VPN to your corporate network, you or your network administrator must configure
your gateway device outside of Anypoint Platform.

To facilitate this configuration, you provide information about your gateway device, which
Anypoint Platform uses to generate a connection guide to use to configure your device. 


//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. In the *Network* tab, click *View Connection Guide*.
. In the *VPN Connection Guide* page, select the *Device vendor*, *Device platform*, and *Device software* from the drop-down lists.
. Click *Download Guide*.

+
<screenshot>
+
--
*** The resource share *ID* field contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-).
*** The resource share *Owner* field contains only numbers.
.. Click *Next*.
--

CloudHub 2.0 use the resource share owner and ID you provide to attach
the associated transit gateway on AWS to the private space.

When the attachment succeeds, you see the `Attachment Created` message and 
you return to the *Add Transit Gateway* page.

If the resource share validation fails, see xref:ps-troubleshoot.adoc#troubleshoot-transit-gateway-attachments[Troubleshoot Transit Gateway Attachments].

[[accept-tgw-attachment]]
=== Accept the Attachment 

. In the *Add Transit Gateway* page, click the *Transit Gateway Attachments* link. 
+
The link opens the AWS RAM console to the page for accepting the transit gateway attachments in the region you specified.
. On the *Transit Gateway Attachments* page, select the attachment that shows *pending acceptance* in the *State* column.
+
The attachment might take a few minutes to appear.
+
To verify that the attachment is correct, select the transit gateway attachment ID and, in the *Details* tab, ensure that the *Resource owner account ID* is the MuleSoft AWS account ID from the *Add Transit Gateway* page.
. From the *Actions* menu, select *Accept*.
. When the attachment state changes to *available*, return to the *Add Transit Gateway* page and click *Done*.
+
You return to the *Network* tab for the private space.
The *Connections* section shows the transit gateway ID and owner from AWS and indicates that the transit gateway state is *Available* and the attachment state is *Attached to Private Network*:
+
<screenshot>
// image::tgw-resource-share-available.png[Transit gateway attached]
+
If the VPC attachment state is *Not Attached to VPC*, the transit gateway is not attached.
Click *Accept the attachment* link and follow the steps again.
+
// If the VPC attachment state is `Rejected`, see xref:tgw-troubleshoot.adoc[].
. <<test-connection,Test the connection>> from your private space to the transit gateway.


[[configure-tgw-routing]]
=== Configure Transit Gateway Routing

CloudHub 2.0 supports static routing for transit gateways.

Configure the network routes (subnets) that you want to be accessible through the transit gateway:

* On Anypoint Platform, <<enable-outbound-traffic-from-ps,configure routes for outbound traffic from the private space>> to an external destination.
* On AWS, <<enable-inbound-traffic-on-aws,enable inbound traffic>> through your transit gateway. 

[[enable-outbound-traffic-from-ps]]
==== Configure Routes for Outbound Traffic from the Private Space

After the *Private space attached* message appears, the private spaces adds the routes that you 
<<connect-tgw,specified>>
so that apps deployed to the private space can access the transit gateway.

To add routes to the transit gateway route table, see
xref:ps-manage.adoc#add-or-remove-a-route-in-the-route-table[Add or Remove a Route in the Route Table].

[[enable-inbound-traffic-on-aws]]
==== Enable Inbound Traffic Through the Transit Gateway

After successfully adding routes to the transit gateway route table in Anypoint Platform, enable inbound traffic through your transit gateway on AWS. 

You might need to coordinate with your network administrator to enable inbound traffic.


[[test-connection]]
== Test the Connection to Your Private Space

After you create the VPN or connect to a transit gateway,
test the connectivity from CloudHub 2.0 to your networks.
To test the connection, use the Network Tools application.

For download and usage information about the Network Tools application, see https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-To-Use-Network-Tools-Application[How To Use Network Tools Application^] (KB article).
