= Creating Private Spaces

*This topic is updated to the Private Space (03-Nov) and Private Network (08-Nov) Design Specs*

*Last update* 07-Mar-22

To extend your network to Anypoint Platform, create a _private space_, 
a virtual, private, and isolated network hosted in CloudHub 2.0,
to deploy your apps to.

You can't change the private network configuration after it's created.
To change the configuration, delete the private space and create it again.
See xref:ps-manage.adoc[].

--
.. Select the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#private-network-region[region] where you want your apps to run.
.. Enter the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#cidr-block[CIDR block], which is the range of IP addresses that your apps can use.
.. Click *Create*.

The private network can take up to 30 minutes to create.

While the network is created, you can 
<<create-connection-to-external-network,create a connection to an external network>>.
. After the network creation succeeds, you can xref:ch2-deploy-private-space.adoc[deploy an application] to test the private network connection.

If the private network creation fails, delete it and click *Create Private Network* to try again.

[[resolve-private-domains]]
=== Resolve Private Domains in Your Internal Network

If your corporate network uses internal DNS servers to resolve requests to custom domains, configure the private space with these IP addresses and domain names.
The private space uses your internal DNS to resolve internal host names of your private network (make sure your applications call the backend resources by FQDN).

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, click the *Configure* link for *Internal DNS Servers*.
. Enter the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#server-ip-addresses[server IP addresses] for your internal DNS servers.
. Enter the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#domains[domain addresses] to be resolved by internal DNS.
. Click *Save*.

After you configure internal DNS, the *Network* tab indicates the number of configured server IP addresses and domains:

[[create-connection-to-external-network]]
== Create a Connection to an External Network

After you create your private network, connect it to an external network using a 
VPN or transit gateway attachment.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. In the *Network* tab, click *Create Connection*. 
. On the *Create Connection* page, select the connection type, enter the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#vpn-name[name], and click *Next*.
+
Depending on the connection type you selected:
+
** *VPN*: Follow the steps in xref:ps-create-configure-vpn.adoc[].
** *Transit Gateway*: Follow the steps in xref:ps-create-configure-tgw.adoc[].
