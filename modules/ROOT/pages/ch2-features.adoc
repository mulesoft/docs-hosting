= Features of CloudHub 2.0

*This topic will (eventually) be replaced with an updated version of https://docs.mulesoft.com/general/intro-platform-hosting#support-matrix-for-runtime-plane-hosting-options[Support Matrix for Runtime Plane Hosting Options].*

CloudHub 2.0 includes many of the features from CloudHub 1.0 and Runtime Fabric on-premises.

//// 
== Features Included in the Internal Validation Release

This internal validation release enables users to create a single-tenant instance, deploy and manage applications, monitor application metrics via Anypoint Monitoring, and forward logs to an external logging service.

[IMPORTANT]
This release is targeted to internal engineering and support teams only.

This release includes these features:

* xref:ps-create-configure.adoc#create-a-private-space[Create a private space]:
+
** Infrastructure provisioning
** Private space support per customer

* *Internal* operational monitoring and alerting
+
CloudHub 2.0 alerts you when when applications become unresponsive.
* Load-based cluster-level autoscaling
+
CloudHub 2.0 provides auto-scaling groups for fault-tolerance.
* Bursting and CPU oversubscription for application deployments
* Application administration and supportability
* Custom properties
+
For information on setting custom properties, see 
xref:ch2-manage-props.adoc[].
* xref:ch2-deploy.adoc[].
