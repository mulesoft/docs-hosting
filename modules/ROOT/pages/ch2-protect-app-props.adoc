CloudHub 2.0 enables you to protect application property values by displaying the property name but not its value, in Anypoint Runtime Manager, 

Additionally, the value is not viewable or retrievable by any user.
CloudHub 2.0 resolves the property internally at runtime.
These protected application values are encrypted and stored in the Anypoint Security secrets manager, which, in turn, is encrypted per user organization.

[IMPORTANT]
Protected property values are separate from the encrypted Mule application properties stored in secure configuration files. 
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/secure-configuration-properties[Secure Configuration Properties^] (link out from Beta docs).

== Protect Property Values in Runtime Manager

Set protected properties via the table view for granular control over each property and value. 

Although you can attempt to protect a single property more than once, Runtime Manager issues a warning and protects only the final instance of that property.

. Click the app name and then click *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab.
. Depending on how many properties you want to protect, choose either:
** To protect properties one at a time, click *Table view*.
** To protect multiple properties, use *Text view* to add the key-value pairs, switch to *Table view*, and continue to Step 8 to protect the properties. 
. In the *New Key* field, add a property to protect. 
. In the *New Value* field, add a value.
. In the value field, click *Protect* and then click *Protect value* to confirm.

. Depending on the deployment status, choose either:
** If this application is deployed, click *Apply changes*.
** If youâ€™re ready to deploy the application, click *Deploy Application*.

In the *Properties* tab, the values for properties that you just protected are now no longer visible to you or any other user.

In the following example, the values for `birthdate` and `password` are protected, but the value for `username` is not:

After you commit the values and deploy the app, the protected property values
don't appear in the console and aren't sent and received between the console and CloudHub.

== Replace a Protected Property Value

After you set the property value, you can't retrieve it.
However, you can replace the protected property value with a new protected value:

. In the table view, click the icon next to the protected value that you want to replace. 
. Click the menu icon next to the value and then click *Replace protected value*.
. Enter a new value in the field:

. Click *Apply*. 
. Click *Apply changes*.

== Copy Protected Property Values between Sandboxes

When moving applications between sandboxes, the property name is copied, but the value is left blank.
