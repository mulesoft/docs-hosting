= Associating Environments and Business Groups with a Private Space

*This topic is updated to the Design Spec dated 09-Nov-21*

*Last update* 10-Feb-22

Before you can deploy to a private space, you must specify the environments and at least one business group to associate with it.
This association specifies in which environments the private space appears as 
a target deployment in the *Deployment Target* list when deploying an app. 
For information, see xref:ch2-deploy-private-space.adoc[].

You can associate a private space with the production and sandbox environments
in the business group, and its child business groups, that it's registered with or with a subset of business groups.

By default, a private space is associated with all sandbox environments in its business groups.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
