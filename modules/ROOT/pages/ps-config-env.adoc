= Associating Environments and Business Groups with a Private Space

*This topic is updated to the Design Spec dated 09-Nov-21*

*Last update* 13-Jul-22

Before you can deploy to a private space, you must specify the environments and at least one business group to associate with it.
This association specifies in which environments the private space appears as 
a target deployment in the *Deployment Target* list when deploying an app. 
For information, see xref:ch2-deploy-private-space.adoc[].

You can associate a private space with the production and sandbox environments
in the business group, and its child business groups, that it's registered with or with a subset of business groups.

By default, a private space is associated with all sandbox environments in its business groups.

== Associate Environments and Business Groups

If you have the CloudHub Network Administrator permission, associate environments in the business group or groups with the private space:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. Click the *Environments* tab.
. Select the environments from the drop-down list:
+
--
** *All environments*
+
Associates the private space with all sandbox and production environments in the business group and its children.
** *Sandbox environments*
+
Associates the private space with only sandbox environments in the business group and its children.
** *Production environments*
+
Associates the private space with only production environments in the business group and its children.
--
. Select the business groups from the drop-down list:
+
--
** *This business group and its children*
** *Selected business group*
+
Enter the business group name in the *Add business group* field and select it from the list.
+
The list includes the business group and its child business groups to which the private space is registered and that have not yet been added.
