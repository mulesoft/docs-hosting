= Managing Private Spaces

*This topic is updated to the Private Network Design Specs/UI dated 09-Nov-21*

*Last update* 07-Mar-22

Use Anypoint Runtime Manager to manage private spaces,
such as adding and removing a route from the route table or
detaching a transit gateway from the private space.

[[rename-private-space]]
== Rename a Private Space

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. Click the Private Space menu (*...*) and select *Rename*.

[[delete-private-space]]
== Delete a Private Space

You can't delete a private space if it has any related private network, VPNs, or transit gateway attachments.
You can't undo this action.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]

// image::ps-delete.png[Delete option in the Private Space menu]
. Click *Delete* to confirm the deletion.

[[delete-private-network]]
== Delete a Private Network 

Deleting a private network also deletes its external network connection (VPN or transit gateway attachment).
You can't undo this action.

You can't delete a network if it is currently in use.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]

. Click *Delete* to confirm the deletion.

[[add-remove-routes]]
== Add or Remove a Route from the Route Table

Routes determine how to direct traffic from your private space, for example,
to the public internet or through a transit gateway.

You might want to add a route to enable a new subnet to be accessible or remove a route if you no longer want a subnet to be accessible through the transit gateway.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Private network* section, click *Edit Routes*:
+
<screenshot>
// image::tgw-add-vpc-route.png[Add VPC route]
+
--
** Add a route by entering the subnet in CIDR notation, selecting the connection,
and clicking *Add Route*:
+
<screenshot>
// image::ps-edit-route.png[Route Table window]
+
You can't add a route that matches a priority route (a route that's used by your private network).
+
Routes can be used by only one connection at a time.
If you enter a non-local/Internet Gateway (IGW) route, CloudHub 2.0 warns that the route is being used by another connection.
+
Routes should not overlap with existing routes.
CloudHub 2.0 warns if you enter a route that overlaps with another route in the route table.
** Remove a route by clicking the *X* icon for a row in the table and then clicking *Delete* to confirm.
+
<screenshot>
// image::ps-edit-route.png[Route Table window]
+
If the *X* icon doesn't appear for a route, you can't remove it.
+
You can remove routes for static VPN connections. 
--
. Click *Done*.

Anypoint Platform submits the new route to AWS.

//// 
In the route table, added routes show *Transit Gateway* as the value in the *Next Hop* column:

[[rename-connection]]
== Rename a Connection

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the Connections menu (*...*) and select *Rename*:

[[change-vpn-connection]]
== Change VPN Connection Settings

You can change the tunnel initiation behavior after configuring the VPN connection.

This setting applies to all VPNs in this connection and is enabled by default.

[IMPORTANT]
Modifying the tunnel initiation after VPN creation causes all VPNs in this connection to restart.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the VPN menu (*...*) and select *Rename & Options*:
+
<update screenshot>
+
image::vpn-view-details.png[View Details option in the VPN menu]
. Select *Automatic Tunnel Initiation* to specify that VPN starts up automatically.
+
If you deselect this option, you must generate traffic from the customer gateway
to establish VPN tunnels.
. Click *Save & Restart* or *Cancel* to close the *Connection Settings* window.


[[view-vpn-status]]
== View VPN Status

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]

. Click *Delete* to confirm the deletion.

[[rename-tgw]]
== Rename a Transit Gateway Attachment 

You might want to rename a transit gateway attachment to match the attachment name in AWS. 

To rename a transit gateway attachment:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the transit gateway menu (*...*) and select *Rename*:
+
<screenshot>
// image::tgw-rename.png[Rename option in the transit gateway menu]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=renameItem]

[[detach-tgw]]
== Detach a Transit Gateway from the Private Space

You might need to detach a transit gateway so that you can reattach it.

Detaching a transit gateway from a private space also deletes the attachment in AWS.
The resource share on AWS remains unaffected.
Any apps deployed to the private space continue to run, but they are no longer connected to your Amazon VPCs and VPNs.

To detach the transit gateway:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the transit gateway menu (*...*) and select *Detach*:
+
<screenshot>
// image::tgw-detach-vpc.png[Detach transit gateway option in the transit gateway menu]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Detach*.
+
Detaching a transit gateway might take several minutes.

[[remove-tgw]]
== Remove a Transit Gateway Attachment

You might want to remove a transit gateway attachment for the following reasons:

* If you reject an attachment in AWS, the transit gateway attachment appears as `Rejected` in Anypoint Platform.
In this case, you must remove the attachment before trying to attach it again.
* If an attachment is deleted on AWS, you can remove the attachment from Anypoint Platform.

Removing a transit gateway attachment also deletes any associate routes.
The resource share on AWS remains unaffected so you can readd the transit gateway without creating a new one.

To completely remove the transit gateway from your Anypoint Platform organization, 
delete the resources share on AWS.
For information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-delete.html[Deleting a resource share^] in the AWS documentation.

To remove a transit gateway attachment:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the transit gateway menu (*...*) and select *Remove*:
+
// image::tgw-remove-vpc.png[Remove transit gateway attachment option in the transit gateway menu]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Remove*.

Removing a transit gateway attachment might take several minutes.
