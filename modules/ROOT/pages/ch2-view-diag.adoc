= Viewing Diagnostic Data for Deployed Apps

*Last update* 08-Aug-22

You can run a thread dump, which is a snapshot of all the threads in a replica.
The thread dump indicates the current state of the server,
which is helpful for debugging and support.

CloudHub 2.0 retains thread dumps for 30 days or up to 100 MB.

== Run a Thread Dump

[NOTE]
The app must be running to run a thread dump.

To run a thread dump:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickDiagnostics]
. Click *Run Thread Dump* and select the active replica to trigger the thread dump from the drop-down list:

+
CloudHub 2.0 runs the thread dump and displays the latest thread dump at the top of the list.
+
When the thread dump is ready to download, the *Download* button becomes available.
// If the *Diagnostics* page is displayed when the thread dump is ready, the download starts automatically.

== View and Download Past Thread Dumps

To view past thread dumps:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
. In the navigation menu, click *Diagnostics*.
+
The page displays any past thread dumps:

+
* To view logs for a deployment and replica associated with the thread dump, click the *View Logs* link (1) in the *Replica* column.
* To download a thread dump, click the *Download* button (2).

CloudHub 2.0 saves the diagnostic output to a text file in a hexadecimal format, for example: `5b181bef-b61c-524c-a0c8-698592977954_2022-07-20T15-06-27D`. Use a text editor to view the diagnostics file.
