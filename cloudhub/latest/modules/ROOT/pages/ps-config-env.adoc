To associate environment types in a business group or groups with the private space:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. Click the *Environments* tab.
. Select the environments from the dropdown list:
+
--
** *Any environment*
** *Sandbox environments*
** *Production environments*
--
. Select the business groups from the dropdown list:
+
--
** *Any business group*
** *Selected business group*
+
Type the business group name in the *Add business groups* field and select it from the list.

The list includes all business groups in the organization to which the private space is registered and that have not yet been added.
