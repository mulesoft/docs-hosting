Private space names can contain up to 60 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), spaces, and hyphens (-).
Runtime Manager supports Unicode characters in private space names.
+
The private space name appears in the list when you select a deployment target for your apps.

You can rename a private space, if necessary.


== Create a Private Network

[IMPORTANT]
You can't change the private network configuration after it's created.
To change the configuration, delete the private network and create it again.

. Select the region. 
. Enter the CIDR block.
+
The CIDR block is the range of IP addresses that your apps can use.
. Click *Create*.

The private network can take up to 30 minutes to create.
After the network creation succeeds, you can deploy an application to test the private network.  

If the private network creation fails, delete it and click *Create network* to try again.
