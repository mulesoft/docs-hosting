When you deploy an application to CloudHub 2.0, Runtime Manager automatically versions the application and creates a new _configuration_.

Application configurations enable you to:

* View the configuration change history of the application.
* Roll back the configurations to an earlier version if the currently applied configuration has issues or is unstable.
* View the application status.
+
Possible values are:
+
Running:: At least one replica is receiving traffic (Started state).
Not running:: None of the replicas are receiving traffic.
Unknown:: The target is disconnected.
* Make updates to a deployed applicationâ€™s configuration, including:
+
** Application file
** Application deployment package version
** Deployment target settings, such as runtime version, number of replicas, and whether the application is running in cluster mode
** Public endpoint and TLS settings
** Resource allocations, including CPU and memory
** App property values
* View logs and diagnostics associated with a configuration.
