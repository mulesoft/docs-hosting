=== Resource Share Attachments

If you get the following messages when attaching a resource share,
verify that you entered the correct resource share ID and owner:

* `We couldnâ€™t find a matching resource share. Please review the ID and Owner and try again.`
* `This resource share is already in use by this organization or a different organization.`

=== Transit Gateway State is Unknown

If the Transit Gateway state is unknown, the resource share has probably 
been disabled or deleted.

In this case, resolve this issue on AWS.
