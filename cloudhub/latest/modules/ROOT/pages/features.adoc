Runtime Fabric Cloud includes many of the features from CloudHub and Runtime Fabric on-premises.

== Features Included in the Internal Beta Release

This internal Beta release enables users to create a single-tenant instance, deploy and manage applications, monitor application metrics via Anypoint Monitoring, and forward logs to an external logging service.

[IMPORTANT]
This release is targeted to internal engineering and support teams only.

This release includes these features:

* xref:ps-create-configure.adoc#create-a-private-space[Create a private space]:
+
** Infrastructure provisioning
** VPC support per customer

* *Internal* operational monitoring and alerting
+
Runtime Fabric Cloud alerts you when when applications become unresponsive.
* Load-based cluster-level autoscaling
+
Runtime Fabric Cloud provides auto-scaling groups for fault-tolerance.
* Bursting and CPU oversubscription for application deployments
* Application administration and supportability
* Custom properties
+
For information on setting custom properties, see 
https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/cloudhub-manage-props.html#add-application-properties-in-runtime-manager[Add Application Properties in Runtime Manager].
* xref:ps-create-configure.adoc#test-the-private-network-by-deploying-an-app[Deploy Mule apps to a private space].
