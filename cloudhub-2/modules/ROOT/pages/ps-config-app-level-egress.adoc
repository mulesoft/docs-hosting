= Configuring Application-Level Egress Rules

Application-level egress rules are independent of private-space-level firewall rules. For egress traffic to go through, it must pass both private space and application-level control.


== Before You Begin

* Set up your private space and finish provisioning your private network.
* Verify that your account has CloudHub Network Viewer permission, which is required to view a private space's firewall and application-level rules.
* Verify that your account has CloudHub Network Administrator permission, which is required to modify a private space's firewall and application-level rules.

== Configure Application-Level Rules in Your Private Space

To configure the application-level rules in a private space:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager* > *Private Spaces*.
. Click the name of the private space to manage.
. On the *Firewall rules* tab, expand the *App-Level Rules* section.

By default, the application-level egress rules feature is disabled when you create a new private space. Toggle the feature to enable it.

[NOTE]
Ensure that you finished provisioning your private network before enabling the toggle.

Toggling *App-Level Egress Rules* enables the *Default-Egress-Rule-Group*. The default egress rule is *Allow any protocol to any destination*.

To modify the default egress rule group:

. Click *Edit*.
. In the *Egress Rules* section of the group configuration window, select the desired protocol and destination.
. Click *Add Rule* to add new rules to the rule group.
+ 
You can delete rules by clicking the delete button (image:trash-icon.png[Delete button, 2%,2%]).
. Click *Update Egress Rules* to save your changes.
+
Your changes affect all applications in the current private space.
+
You cannot rename or delete the default rule group.

To create a new custom egress rule group:

. Click *Create Rule Group*.
. In the rule group configuration window, add a group name.
+ 
You can edit and rename custom rule groups. 
. In the *Egress Rules* section, click *Add Rule* and select the protocol and destination for every rule that you want to add.
+ 
You can delete rules by clicking the delete button (image:trash-icon.png[Delete button, 2%,2%]).
. Click *Create Egress Rules* to save your changes.
+
To use custom rule groups, select them in the application settings.

To delete an existing custom rule group: 

.  Select *More actions* (image:more-icon.png[More actions menu, 2%,2%]) > *Delete*. 
. When prompted, click *Delete Rule Group* to confirm the deletion.
+
[NOTE]
Once you delete a custom rule group, any applications that use it immediately start using the default egress rule group instead.

You can disable the application-level egress rule feature by clicking the feature's toggle. When prompted, click *Delete and Disable App-Level Rules* to confirm. 

[NOTE]
Once you disable the application-level egress rule feature, all custom application-level egress rule groups are deleted, and all application-level egress is allowed for all applications.

== Apply Application-Level Egress Rules When Deploying Your Applications

You can apply the application-level egress rules that you configured in your private space when you deploy an application:

. When deploying an application to your private space, select the *Firewall Rules* tab.
+
. In the *Egress Rule Group* section, select the ruleset to apply to your application. 
. Click *Apply Changes*.


== Configure an Application-Level Egress Connection to Anypoint MQ

To allow HTTPS connections to Anypoint MQ, add an application-level egress rule group with the following rules:

Allow egress to the Anypoint control plane:

* *Protocol*: `HTTPS`
* *Destination*: `Custom Domains`
** With value:
*** For prod: `anypoint.mulesoft.com`
*** For prod-eu: `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`

Allow egress to the MQ destination:

* *Protocol*: HTTPS
* *Destination*: `Custom Domains`
** With the value of the domain name configured in the MQ connector URL
+
For example, if the MQ connector URL is `https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/{{anypointOrgId}}/environments/{{anypointEnvId}}/`,
use the value `mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`.

== Configure an Application-Level Egress Connection to ObjectStore v2

To allow HTTPS connections to Object Store v2, add an application-level egress rule group with the following rules:

Allow egress to the Anypoint control plane:

* *Protocol*: `HTTPS`
* *Destination*: `Custom Domains`
** With value:
*** For prod: `anypoint.mulesoft.com`
*** For prod-eu: `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`

Allow egress to the Object Store v2 destination

* *Protocol*: `HTTPS`
* *Destination*: `Custom Domains`
** With value:
*** For prod: `object-store-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
*** For prod-eu: `[xxx]`
+
This URL varies depending on the region. For example, to access Object Store in `ap-southeast-1`, add the URL `object-store-ap-southeast-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` as the value.

If you enable egress for a domain that includes redirection, such as when `https://salesforce.com` redirects to `https://www.salesforce.com`, allow egress for both the original target, `salesforce.com`, and the redirected target, `www.salesforce.com`.

== Configure an Application-Level Egress Connection to API Manager

To add application-level egress support to API Manager, add a custom rule group with the following rule to allow egress to the Anypoint control plane:

* *Protocol*: `HTTPS`
* *Destination*: `Custom Domains`
** With value:
*** For prod: `anypoint.mulesoft.com`
*** For prod-eu: `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`

[NOTE]
When configuring application-level egress connections to Anypoint MQ, Object Store v2, or API Manager, you must also allow outbound access to all 443 ports at the private-space level separately.

== Performance Impact

Given the extra layer of validation, using the application-level egress rules can introduce three-minute to ten-minute network latency delays to your applications' connections. To balance security and performance:

* Limit active rule groups to 20 in your private space.
* Use a maximum of 40 rules per rule group.
* Limit the total combination of rule groups and rules to 800. 
+
You can customize the number of rule groups and rules in the combination based on your needs.

These measures help optimize latency while maintaining effective network security.

[NOTE]
DNS record timing issues can sometimes lead to unexpected connectivity errors. To enhance the reliability of Mule applications, implement robust error handling and connection retry mechanisms.
