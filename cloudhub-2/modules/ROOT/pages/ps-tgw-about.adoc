= Transit Gateway Attachments

*Last update* 06-May-22


AWS Transit Gateway acts as a cloud router in AWS, simplifying network access between private spaces,
on-premises data centers, and third-party software, while providing increased visibility and control over the network.
Transit gateways effectively merge your organization’s cloud resources and on-premises datacenters
into one network topology.

On CloudHub 2.0, you can take advantage of this network simplification by securely attaching your private space 
to AWS Transit Gateway in your AWS account.

You can add multiple transit gateways to your Anypoint Platform organization.
The number of transit gateways you can add depends on the network connection entitlements available to your account. 
Contact your MuleSoft account representative if you don't know how many entitlements are associated with your account. 

To use transit gateway attachments, your private space and AWS Transit Gateway must be in the same region.
