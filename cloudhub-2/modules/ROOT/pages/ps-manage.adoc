= Managing Private Spaces

Use Anypoint Runtime Manager to manage private spaces,
such as adding and removing a route from the route table or
detaching a transit gateway from the private space.

[[add-remove-routes]]
== Add or Remove a Route from the Route Table

Routes determine how to direct traffic from your private space, for example,
to the public internet or through a connection (VPN or transit gateway).

You might want to add a route to enable a new subnet to be accessible or remove a route if you no longer want a subnet to be accessible through the transit gateway.

When you create a new private space, you can remove the default routes that MuleSoft provides. However, when you change the default route, your private space might experience downtime. If the *X* icon doesn't appear for a route, you can't remove it. 

You cannot remove the MuleSoft-defined routes for existing private spaces created before March 9, 2023. You must create and configure a new private space to remove the default routes that MuleSoft defines. MuleSoft defines other routes, such as control plane traffic routes, that you cannot view or remove from the route table. Note that Anypoint MQ, ObjectStore v2, and API Manager require internet access from your network.

You can't add a route that matches a priority route (a route that's used by your private network).

Routes can be used by only one connection at a time.
If you enter a non-local/Internet Gateway (IGW) route, CloudHub 2.0 warns that the route is being used by another connection.

Routes should not overlap with existing routes.

[[change-vpn-connection]]
== Change VPN Connection Settings

You can change the tunnel initiation behavior after configuring the VPN connection.

This setting applies to all VPNs in this connection and is enabled by default.

[IMPORTANT]
Modifying the tunnel initiation after VPN creation causes all VPNs in this connection to restart.

. On the *Connection Settings* page, you can:
+
* Enter a new name for the VPN connection.
* Expand *Advanced Options* to change the *Automatic Tunnel Initiation* option.
+
Enable this option to specify that VPN starts up automatically.
+
If you deselect this option, you must generate traffic from the customer gateway
to establish VPN tunnels.
. Click *Save* or *Cancel* to close the *Connection Settings* window.

Modifying the *Automatic Tunnel Initiation* option restarts all VPNs in the connection.

[[enable-vpn-logs]]
== Enable VPN logs

You can enable VPN logs to be directly accessible by MuleSoft support engineers. This shortens the process for obtaining the logs from AWS.

. For VPN connections created after March 8, 2023, VPN logs are enabled by default upon creation.
. For existing VPN connections:
.. You can enable VPN logs via PATCH call to the following existing endpoint:
+
`https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/runtimefabric/api/organizations/{{org-id}}/privatespaces/{{ps-id}}/connections/{{connection-id}}/vpns/{{vpn-id}}`.
+
The payload to enable logs for VPNs with two tunnels without making other changes is `{"vpnTunnels":[{"isLogsEnabled": true}, {"isLogsEnabled": true}]}`.
+
The `isLogsEnabled` flag can only be set to `true`; otherwise, the API returns a 400 error.
+
.. Any updates you make to an existing VPN after March 8, 2023 enables the VPN logs to be directly accessible by MuleSoft Support Engineers.

[NOTE]
Enabling this feature speeds up the process for obtaining VPN logs from AWS, as the MuleSoft support team can download them directly, with no need to raise an AWS support ticket.
