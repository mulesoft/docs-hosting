= Managing Private Spaces

Use Anypoint Runtime Manager to manage private spaces,
such as adding and removing a route from the route table or
detaching a transit gateway from the private space.

[[add-remove-routes]]
== Add or Remove a Route from the Route Table

Routes determine how to direct traffic from your private space, for example,
to the public internet or through a connection (VPN or transit gateway).

You might want to add a route to enable a new subnet to be accessible or remove a route if you no longer want a subnet to be accessible through the transit gateway.

You can remove the default routes that MuleSoft provides. However, when you change the default route, your private space might experience downtime. If the *X* icon doesn't appear for a route, you can't remove it. For private spaces created before March x, 2023, you cannot remove the default routes.

MuleSoft also has routes, such as control plane traffic routes, that you cannot view or remove from the Route table.

You can't add a route that matches a priority route (a route that's used by your private network).

Routes can be used by only one connection at a time.
If you enter a non-local/Internet Gateway (IGW) route, CloudHub 2.0 warns that the route is being used by another connection.

Routes should not overlap with existing routes.
CloudHub 2.0 warns if you enter a route that overlaps with another route in the route table.

Anypoint Platform submits the new route to AWS.

[[change-vpn-connection]]
== Change VPN Connection Settings

You can change the tunnel initiation behavior after configuring the VPN connection.

This setting applies to all VPNs in this connection and is enabled by default.

[IMPORTANT]
Modifying the tunnel initiation after VPN creation causes all VPNs in this connection to restart.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]

. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the VPN menu (*...*) and select *Connection Settings*:
// +
// <screenshot>
// +
// image::vpn-view-details.png[View Details option in the VPN menu]
. On the *Connection Settings* page, you can:
+
* Enter a new name for the VPN connection.
* Expand *Advanced Options* to change the *Automatic Tunnel Initiation* option.
+
Enable this option to specify that VPN starts up automatically.
+
If you deselect this option, you must generate traffic from the customer gateway
to establish VPN tunnels.
. Click *Save* or *Cancel* to close the *Connection Settings* window.
+
Modifying the *Automatic Tunnel Initiation* option restarts all VPNs in the connection.

[[delete-vpn]]
== Delete a VPN

Deleting the last VPN in a connection removes the entire connection.

[IMPORTANT]
You can't undo this action.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the VPN menu (*...*) and select *Delete*:
// +
// <screenshot>
// image::vpn-delete.png[Delete option in the VPN menu]
. Click *Delete* to confirm the deletion or *Cancel*.

[[rename-tgw]]
== Rename a Transit Gateway Attachment 

You might want to rename a transit gateway attachment to match the attachment name in AWS. 

To rename a transit gateway attachment:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the transit gateway menu (*...*) and select *Rename*:
// +
// <screenshot>
// image::tgw-rename.png[Rename option in the transit gateway menu]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=renameItem]

[[detach-tgw]]
== Detach a Transit Gateway from the Private Space

You might need to detach a transit gateway so that you can reattach it.

Detaching a transit gateway from a private space also deletes the attachment in AWS.
The resource share on AWS remains unaffected. The transit gateway appears under *Add a transit gateway* if you only detach it and do not delete it from your organization.
Any apps deployed to the private space continue to run, but they are no longer connected to your Amazon VPCs and VPNs.

To detach the transit gateway:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the transit gateway menu (*...*) and select *Detach*:
// +
// <screenshot>
// image::tgw-detach-vpc.png[Detach transit gateway option in the transit gateway menu]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Detach*.
+
Detaching a transit gateway might take several minutes.

[[remove-tgw]]
== Remove a Transit Gateway Attachment

You might want to remove a transit gateway attachment for the following reasons:

* If you reject an attachment in AWS, the transit gateway attachment appears as `Rejected` in Anypoint Platform.
In this case, you must remove the attachment before trying to attach it again.
* If an attachment is deleted on AWS, you can remove the attachment from Anypoint Platform.

Removing a transit gateway attachment also deletes any associate routes.
The resource share on AWS remains unaffected so you can readd the transit gateway without creating a new one.

To completely remove the transit gateway from your Anypoint Platform organization, 
use the `DELETE <>/organizationns/:orgId/transitgateways/:tgw-id` API call and delete the resources share on AWS.
For information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-delete.html[Deleting a resource share^] in the AWS documentation.
