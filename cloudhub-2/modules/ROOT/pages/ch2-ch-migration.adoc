= Migrating from CloudHub to CloudHub 2.0

If your organization uses CloudHub, you can facilitate the migration process to CloudHub 2.0 by using Runtime Manager's interface for creating private spaces based on existing VPCs.

== Before You Begin

You must have the following xref:access-management::permissions-by-product.adoc[permissions] to complete VPC to private space conversion: 

* Organization Administrator over the root organization
* CloudHub Network Administrator from Runtime Manager
* CloudHub Network Viewer from Runtime Manager
* Create Applications permission from Runtime Manager

If you do not have the required permissions for this process, contact your organization administrator.
