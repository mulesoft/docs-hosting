= Configuring Domains and Certificates (TLS Context) for a Private Space

CloudHub 2.0 uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) contexts to encrypt
inbound traffic to the private space.

TLS contexts enable your apps to be reached at custom domains and, optionally, enable partial client authentication.

Each private space includes one TLS context by default (for traffic to `cloudhub.io`), which can't be removed.
The default certificate renews automatically and requires no action from the user.
You can create additional TLS contexts as required.

The TLS contexts that you configure for the private space define the domains that are available
when deploying apps to the private spaces.
See xref:ch2-config-endpoints-paths.adoc[].

== TLS Contexts

Each TLS context includes a keystore and an optional truststore.

To <<create-tls-context,create a TLS context>>:

. Upload the keystore.
. Upload the truststore (optional).
. Accept the default ciphers or select ciphers to add or remove.


=== Keystore

A _keystore_ is a repository of security certificates (either authorization certificates or public key certificates), along with their corresponding private keys used, for example, in SSL encryption.

The keystore allows communication to your app using custom domains.

CloudHub 2.0 supports the following keystore types:

PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)::
+
A PEM file is a Base64-encoded ASCII file with a `.cer`, `.crt`, or `.pem` extension.
+
For PEM, the keystore consists of:
+
--
*** Public certificate
*** Private key
*** Certificate Authority (CA) path file (optional)

The keystore in PEM format uses TLS default values.
--
JKS (Java Keystore)::
+
A JKS file is a repository for authorization or public key certificates and does not store secret keys.
+
Use this option to upload a JKS file and use TLS default values.
With this option, you can't change the default values for TLS versions, ciphers, and other TLS configuration options.

=== Truststore

A truststore is a set of client certificates that the server checks against to enforce partial client authentication.
The optional truststore identifies trusted external clients or certificate authorities (CAs).

To enable partial client authentication, configure a truststore.
If a truststore is not configured, partial client authentication is disabled.

CloudHub 2.0 accepts truststore files in PEM formats.

=== DNS Targets

Configure a DNS target to allow clients to reach your applications from within or outside of the private network.

_Public DNS targets_ allow external clients to reach your applications at custom domains.
_Private DNS targets_ can only be reached from inside a private network, or through VPN or transit gateway connections. Use them with internal DNS or allowlists in your connected external networks, so clients in those networks may make requests to your applications.

=== Ciphers

When you add the TLS context, you can select the ciphers to use with the TLS context.

[NOTE]
====
The following TLSv1.1 ciphers are deprecated:
```
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
```

== Before You Begin

. Generate a keystore:
+
** xref:ps-config-ssl-endpoints.adoc#pem[PEM]
** xref:mule-runtime::tls-configuration.adoc#generate-a-keystore[JKS]
. Generate a xref:mule-runtime::tls-configuration.adoc#truststore-generation[truststore] (if you want to enable partial client authentication).
. Create DNS records for your domains.
+
To enable traffic to reach the apps deployed to the private space using a custom domain:
+
.. Log in to your domain registrar.
+
Use https://www.whois.com/[Whois^] to look up your registrar.
.. Create a CNAME record in your vanity domain, pointing to your non-wildcard private space FQDN.
+
Your registrar might take up to 24 hours to apply the change.

. Verify that your account has CloudHub Network Administrator permission, which is required to modify a private space.
+
