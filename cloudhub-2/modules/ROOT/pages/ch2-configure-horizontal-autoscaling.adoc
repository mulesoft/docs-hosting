= Configuring CPU-based Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for CH2 Deployments

You can configure horizontal scaling of Mule applications to make them responsive to CPU usage by automatically scaling up or down the deployment replicas as needed.

In Kubernetes, a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically updates a workload resource, with the aim of automatically scaling the workload to match demand. Horizontal scaling means that the response to increased load is to deploy more pods. For more information, visit the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale[Kubernetes documentaton^]. 

== Configure Horizontal Autoscaling

To configure horizontal autoscaling:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager* > *Applications*.
. Click *Deploy application*.
. In the *Runtime* tab, check the *Enable Autoscaling* box.
. Set the minimum and maximum *Replica Count* limits.
. Click *Deploy Application*.

== Performance Considerations and Limitations

* CPU-based HPA does not work with clustering and rate limiting.
* CPU-based HPA works with 0.1 vCcores replica size only.
* CPU-based HPA is specially useful for Mule applications that scale based on CPU usage. For example, HTTP/HTTPS applications with async requests, or  Mule applications with high throughput (shorter requests, lower latency).


== Autoscaling Status and Logs

When an autoscaling event occurs and your Mule application with horizontal autoscaling scales up, you can check the *Scaling* status by clicking *View status* in your application's details window. You can also see the *Scaling* status of your application in the *Applications* list.

You can track the scaled-up replicas startup and the number of replicas your application scaled from and to by checking the application's logs:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager* > *Applications*.
. Click the row of the application with autoscaling.
. Click *Manage application*.
. Select the *Logs* tab.
