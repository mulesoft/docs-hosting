= Associating Business Groups and Environments with a Private Space

Before deploying to a private space, you can specify environments and at least one business group to associate with it.
This association specifies in which environments the private space appears as a target deployment in the *Deployment Target* list when deploying an app. 
For information, see xref:ch2-deploy-private-space.adoc[].

You can associate a private space with the production and sandbox environments in the business group, and its child business groups, that it's registered with or with a subset of business groups.

By default, a private space is associated with all sandbox environments in its business groups.

If you have the CloudHub Network Administrator permission, associate environments in the business group or groups with the private space:
