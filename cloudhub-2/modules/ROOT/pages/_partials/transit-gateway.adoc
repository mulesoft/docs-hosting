== Rename a Transit Gateway Attachment

You might want to rename a transit gateway attachment to match the attachment name in AWS.

To rename a transit gateway attachment:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the transit gateway menu (*...*) and select *Rename*:

== Detach a Transit Gateway from the Private Space

You might want to detach a transit gateway attachment for the following reasons:

* If you reject an attachment in AWS, the transit gateway attachment appears as `Rejected` in Anypoint Platform.
In this case, you must remove the attachment before trying to attach it again.
* If an attachment is deleted on AWS, you can remove the attachment from Anypoint Platform.

Removing a transit gateway attachment also deletes any associate routes.
The resource share on AWS remains unaffected so you can readd the transit gateway without creating a new one. However, detaching a transit gateway from a private space also deletes the attachment in AWS. 

The transit gateway appears under *Add a transit gateway* if you only detach it and do not delete it from your organization.
Any apps deployed to the private space continue to run, but they are no longer connected to your Amazon VPCs and VPNs.

To detach the transit gateway:

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. On the *Network* tab, in the *Connections* section, click the transit gateway menu (*...*) and select *Detach*:
// +
// <screenshot>
// image::tgw-detach-vpc.png[Detach transit gateway option in the transit gateway menu]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Detach*.

Detaching a transit gateway might take several minutes.
