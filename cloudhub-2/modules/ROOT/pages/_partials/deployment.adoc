= Change App Behavior with Properties

You can configure property values, such as specifying the environment or setting passwords and usernames, during app deployment.

For information about configuring app properties, see:

* xref:ch2-protect-app-props.adoc[]

[[placeholder-table]]
= Placeholders

The subdomain and path support the following optional lowercase placeholders:

[%header,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Placeholder | Resolves to
| `app-name` | Name of the app that you specified in the *Application Name* field when you deploy the app
| `business-group-id` | Business group ID associated with the app
| `environment-id` | Environment that you deploy the app to
|===
// end::placeholders[]

// tag::path-name-reqs[]
Paths must start and end with an alphanumeric character and can contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
// end::path-name-reqs[]

// tag::subdomain-name-reqs[]
Subdomains must start and end with an alphanumeric character and can contain only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (-), and periods (.).
// end::subdomain-name-reqs[]

// tag::appNameReqs[]
[[app-name-reqs]]
= Application Names

The application name you specify can contain between 3 and 42 alphanumeric characters
(a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and dashes (-).
They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
The application name must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z). It cannot start with a number or dash and it cannot end with a dash.

To ensure that names are unique and avoid domain conflicts, CloudHub 2.0 adds
a six-character `_unique-id_` to the application name that you specify in the public endpoint URL.

The application name identifies your application not only in Runtime Manager but also in the public `cloudhub.io` domain.
For example, an application named `myapp` is accessible at `\http://myapp-_unique-id_._shard_.usa-w2.cloudhub.io`. You must have unique application names for each deployment target.

To further customize your app names, you can create a naming convention.
For example, you could prepend your company name and department to all application names,
such as `mycompany-mydept-myapp`.
You can then add DNS records to hide the complex application name.
For example, you might route requests to `myapp.mycompany.com` to `mycompany-mydept-myapp-_unique-id_._shard_._region_.cloudhub.io`.

Make application file names as unique as possible. An app cannot be deployed if it shares the same name as an asset in Exchange.

// tag::configureLogging[]
[[configure-logging]]
= Configure Logging for the App

Logging is enabled by default for apps deployed to CloudHub 2.0.

== Disable or Enable Logging

To disable or reenable logging for the app:

. Click the *Logging* tab.
. Deselect or select the *Enable application logs* option.
. Click *Apply Changes*.

If you disable logging, the *Logs* heading still appears in the Runtime Manager navigation menu, but application logs are not collected.

== Configure Log Levels and Categories

To configure additional log levels and categories to include in logs:

. Click the *Monitoring* tab.
. Select the log level:
+
** *INFO*: Informative messages
** *DEBUG*: Debugging messages
** *WARNING*: Warning messages
** *ERROR*: Error messages, such as when an exception occurs
** *FATAL*: Fatal messages for when an application fails

. Optionally, set the log level for specific a Java package class by selecting the log level, entering the `package.name`, and pressing the Enter key.
. Click *Apply Changes*.

// tag::enableDistributedTracing[]

== Enable Trace Data Collection

Traces enable you to understand the execution path of a transaction in MuleSoft ecosystem by having full visibility into the execution path of API calls or application transactions. This feature exposes tracing information in OpenTelemetry standard from Mule runtime into all APM solutions.

You can enable trace data collection for your CloudHub 2.0 applications running on Mule runtime version 4.6 or later. 

To enable distributed tracing in your application deployments:

. Click the *Monitoring* tab.
. Select the *Enable tracing* checkbox.
. Click *Deploy Application* if you are enabling the feature for a new deployment, or *Apply Changes* if you are editing an existing application.

Once you enable tracing, the Runtime Manager backend starts instrumenting traces for your application.

// tag::specifyRuntimeOpts[]
[[specify-runtime-options]]
== Specify Runtime Options 

Click the *Runtime* tab and specify the following options:

Runtime version::
Specifies the Mule runtime engine version. Versions 4.3.x, 4.4.x, and 4.5.x are supported.
Use Edge Release Channel::
Starting with Mule 4.5, MuleSoft introduces two new release channels, xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/lts-edge-release-cadence.adoc[Edge and Long-term Support (LTS)].
+
For new applications, the *Use Edge Release Channel* box is enabled by default. Uncheck this box if you want to use an LTS or a legacy runtime version.
+
For existing applications using a legacy version, the *Use Edge Release Channel* box is disabled by default. The *Runtime version* dropdown list indicates if there is an update available, as well as the previous and latest version of the application. Check the  *Use Edge Release Channel* box if you want to change to an Edge version.
+
For existing applications using an Edge version, the *Use Edge Release Channel* box is enabled by default. The *Runtime version* dropdown list indicates if there is an update available, as well as the previous and latest version of the application. Uncheck the  *Use Edge Release Channel* box if you want to change to a legacy version.
+
For existing applications running on a legacy version that was originally deployed using an Edge version, you must Check the  *Use Edge Release Channel* box to see the previous version on the *Runtime version* dropdown list.
+
For existing applications using an Edge version on extended support, a warning message appears indicating the version's EOL.
Replica size::
Specifies the number of vCores in the replica to run your application.
+
For information on replica sizes, memory, and storage, see
xref:ch2-architecture.adoc#cloudhub-2-replicas[CloudHub 2.0 Replicas].
CloudHub 2.0 limits the replica size per deployment to four vCores.
Replica Count::
Specifies the number of replicas, or instances, of the application to deploy.
+
A minimum of two replicas is required for high availability.
Run in Runtime Cluster Mode::
Enables xref:ch2-clustering.adoc[Mule clustering] across each replica of the application.
+
This option requires at least two replicas.
// Is this on Production?
Use Object Store V2::
You can select xref:object-store::index.adoc[Object Store v2] as the implementation for Mule 3 and Mule 4 by checking the *Use Object Store V2* checkbox.

Deployment model::
+
--
* *Rolling update*:
** Maintains availability by incrementally updating replicas.

* *Recreate*:
** Terminates replicas before redeployment.
** Redeployment is faster and doesn't require additional resources.
