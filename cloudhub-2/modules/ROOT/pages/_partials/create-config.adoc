= CIDR Block 

The _CIDR block_ is the range of IPv4 addresses, in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation
that the apps deployed in your private space use.
The CIDR block defines the size of the private space.
For example, to grant your private network 256 IP addresses between `10.111.0.0` and `10.111.0.255`, 
set the CIDR block to `10.111.0.0/24`.

When you create a private space, you must specify the CIDR block.
You can't resize or change the CIDR block after you create the private space.
For this reason, ensure that you correctly anticipate your requirements before configuring this parameter.

We recommend a `/22` block.

Because some addresses are reserved for fault tolerance, infrastructure, and zero-downtime,
the allowed block size that you can assign for your Anypoint VPC is between `/16` and `/24`. Note that the size of the block does not limit the number of IPs that your apps can use.

When specifying CIDR blocks, ensure that the CIDR blocks:

* Are from a private IP space.
* Don't overlap with any other CIDR blocks assigned to your other private spaces.
* Don't overlap with any CIDR blocks in use in your corporate network.

MuleSoft recommends using subnets from standard RFC 1918 addresses, such as `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, and `192.168.0.0/16`.

Optionally, if you want to connect your private space to your corporate network (either on-premises or in the cloud), specify reserved CIDR blocks for your private space to prevent IP address overlap. Use CIDR notation and commas: `192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12`.

You cannot use the following reserved CIDR blocks:

----
100.64.0.0/10 
198.19.0.0/16
224.0.0.0/4
169.254.0.0/16
127.0.0.0/8
0.0.0.0/8
100.64.0.0/16
100.66.0.0/16
100.67.0.0/16
100.68.0.0/16

// Shared Consolidate Networks

Before configuring routing, consolidate networks to the fewest number possible.
A maximum of 95 route table entries is allowed per private space,
regardless of the number of connections.
